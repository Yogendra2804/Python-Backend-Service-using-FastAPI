# Python-Backend-Service-using-FastAPI
A Python backend service built with FastAPI that ingests structured data, stores it in a SQLite database, and exposes RESTful APIs for querying and managing the data.  This project is being continuously expanded to explore backend development concepts such as data ingestion, database design, ORM integration, validation, and API best practices.

This repository is updated regularly as I learn new backend concepts and features are learned and implemented.
